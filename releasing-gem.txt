These are my notes to help me release new gem versions.

Make all changes on the develop branch. Run rubocop and address any new
violations. Run rspec and address any new test failures.

Start a new git flow release and:
* Update VERSION
* Update CHANGELOG
* If needed update README
* If needed update docs/index.md

Finish the release and make sure all changes, and tags, are pushed to Github.

Run `rake release`. Have 2FA on hand.
