These are my notes to help me release new gem versions.

Essentially make all changes on the develop branch. Update VERSION. Update
CHANGELOG. If needed update README. If needed update docs/index.md.

Run rubocop and address any new violations.

Run rspec and address any new test failures.

Commit and push all changes. Merge changes into master.

Run `rake release`. Have 2FA on hand.

Make sure all changes, and tags, are pushed to Github. Merges changes into
develop.
